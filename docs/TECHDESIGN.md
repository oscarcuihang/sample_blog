# Sample Blog
### Technical Design
This is a blog Rails App. User is ble to create account and post blogs.

Tech Stack

| Tables | Rails Version|
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Server | Rails |
| Websocket | ActionCable |
| Database | ActiveRecord(Any DB) |


#### Backend ([Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/))

Rails is a powerful framework for fullstack project. By initialize a new project, generate new MVCs, the project is good to run at any time.

Difficulties and Solutions:

1. User System with [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)
  * User system has a `.erb` version UI, need to be changed to haml or other front end UI
  * Doesn't implement user count retrieval by email

#### UI Frameworks
##### [rails-bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass)
This this only used on the rails side. The project needs this b/c of the navbar and user system(devise), devise has pre-build front-end in bootstrap. I'll keep as it is until there is a better UI framework,

#### Future Improvements:
1. Reconstruct folder and files directory
2. Add docker to start project with rails
3. Eliminate un-nessary libraries

#### Datamodel
##### User
User Table is ceated by devise, but the core columns are

| Column        | Type           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
|id|int|
|email|string|
|encrypted_password|string|
|name|string|

##### Blog
| Column        | Type           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
|id|int|
|title|string|
|content|text|
|published|boolean|
|view_count|int|
|published_date|date|
